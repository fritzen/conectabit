# Balancebot
Self balancing arduino robot working with Arduino uno, motor controller shield, MUP6050 position and acceleration sensor, DC motors and separate battery packs for arduino and motors.

Go read our blog about the process here:

Download the 3D-models of the body parts from our Thingiverse project:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2359025

Libraries needed for working code:
  - MPU6050
  - I2Cdev (is found inside MPU6050-zip)
  - MotorShied

To get it working yourself, download files balancebotWorking.ino, I2C.ino and Kalman.h. Put them inside a folder and open it with Arduino IDE. That's all!
